program start:
   - read arguments from command line
   - save arguments to simulation struct
   - read matrix from user
   - init matrix by columns
   - init values of matrix from file
we now have a simulation struct and matrix struct


program middle:
    - create threads with pthread_create
    - assign column indexes to each thread
    - function that thread executes will take struct of arguments (column indexes)

    update function:
        - loop through cols/rows and update number
    - after single update, threads wait uisng pthread_barrier_wait

program end:

    - call pthread_join to join threads
    - call barrier_destroy
    - free memory
