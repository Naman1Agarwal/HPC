/*
    single node update function
    follows conway game of rules
    takes one grid and i,j location possibly
    returns 1 or 0 to update
*/

/*
single update function 
    takes two grids
    will loop through first grid and update the second grid based on it
    will use rules
*/

/*
loop to repeat update function
every loop switch pointers for grid 1 and grid 2
*/

/*
Notes: 
    use int_8 to reduce memory size of arr
    each grid is 2 rows and 2 cols bigger
    so that wrapping mechanism is faster

parses args and reads file same way as lab 1
